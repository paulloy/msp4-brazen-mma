## User Story Testing

[1] I want a website thats purpose is immediately evident.
- The landing page of the website reads, "Welcome to Brazen Martial Arts! We work with industry leading suppliers to get you the best gear... at the best price!"
- A call to action "SHOP NOW" displays three buttons that a user familiar to mixed martial arts would recognise.
- Scrolling down the page, the three buttons above are displayed again with carousels featuring products below.
- Prices are displayed on the products, so it is immediately evident that this is a martial arts store.

[2] If I decide to continue browsing the website I want an intuitive and easy navigation that does not require too much time 
to learn to navigate.
- The product navigation is contained within the header. On desktop the product menu is immediately visible. On small screens, the product menu is
contained within a side menu. The header on small screens stays fixed at the top, so a user will know that this header is important.
- Breadcrumbs are displayed so a user has reminders of what kind of products they are currently viewing.
- The product menu contains very few links so it would not take up too much working memory to learn to use.
- Product pages also have breadcrumbs.

[3] I want to be able to be able to quickly compare prices with other products, and take advantage of discounts.
- Products are displayed next to each other in lists. An image is shown, the products name, a price, and for some products, a discount.
- Discounted products are displayed with a red coloured price, with the old price grey and striked through.

[4] I want to be able learn more about a product and save products that I am interested in so I can purchase them after I browse more.
- Product pages come with an enlarged image of the product, its name, a description, and sizes if they have sizes. A size chart displays more information about the size of the product.
- Products can be added to a shopping bag where they are stored so long as the user stays on the webpage.

[5] I want to be able to checkout without having to first register an account.
- Anonymous users can checkout, and receive a confirmation email of their order without having to register an account.

[6] I want to receive an email confirmation of my order and be able to register an account.
- A menu is available in the header at all times where a user can register an account to the website.
- The user is notified at checkout, that they can save their delivery and billing details when they checkout.
- On successful checkout, the user is asked if they would like to create an account.

[7] I want to be able to save my billing and delivery information for quicker future checkouts.
- A logged in user can save their delivery and billing information at checkout so that at their next checkout, the form is automatically filled
and only card details have to be added to complete the checkout.

[8] I want to be able to update my default delivery and billing information.
- Registered users can update their default delivery information at anytime through the accounts menu in the header.

[9] I want to be able to view my past orders.
- A registered user can view their order history at anytime through the accounts menu in the header.

[10] I want to be able to reset my password if I have forgotten it.
- On the login page, their is a link the user can click that will take them to a page where their email address can be submitted.
- The user will receive an email that links them back to the website where they can then change their password, and login to their account.

[11] I want to be able to add new products to the website.
- Within the header in the accounts menu, the store owner can navigate to a product management form that allows them to add new products to the store.
- Validation is included so few errors occur when adding new products.

[12] I want to be able to update products on the website.
- On a products page, a product management menu is displayed to the superuser. There is an update button that takes the user to a product management
update form. The products information is auto filled.
- Validation is included so few errors occur when updating products.

[13] I want to be able to remove products from the website.
- The product management menu mentioned above also includes a remove button. In case the superuser accidentically clicks this button, a second menu opens asking the 
user if they are sure they want to delete the product. The user can then confirm deletion, or cancel.

[14] Be confident that other users cannot add, remove, or update the products on my website.
- Only registered superusers have access to product management. These templates and links are not rendered on the front end unless a user is a superuser.
- Even if a non-superuser had a url to a private page, they must be logged in order to view the page. Non-superusers are forbidden access.
- Only the website administrator can create new superusers. A regular user cannot create a superuser account from the website.
- Product prices are managed in the backend and cannot be accessed without the right secret keys and hidden tokens.

## Responsive Design

Google Chrome Developer tools were used throughout the development to test the responsive design of the project. The deployed website is fully responsive from 320px to 3840px.

The responsive design was also tested at [Am I Responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)

## Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse in Chrome Developer Tools to test my website performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.

 ## Known Issues

 - Test [2.17]: I discovered this bug late in development. Due to time constraints, it has not been fixed yet.
 - Test [5.15]: I have been unable to fix this bug on time. Submitting an empty form will display all products on the website, so it is not a major bug.
 - Using chrome dev tools in the bag template, I can remove the min and max attributes which allows me to update the quantity of a product in my bag to 0, or a number greater than 99. Some backend code.
 should be able to fix this error.
 - The payment_intent.succeeded webhook for my deployed website returns a 500 error. This error does not occur in the development version. This caused confirmation emails to not be sent to the user
 so I've added confirmation emails to [views.py](checkout/views.py). Confirmation emails will now be sent from Heroku. I have been unable to resolve this bug at this time.
 - In flickity.js the variable flky is defined three times. I did this because when I added a carousel class to multiple carousels, only one carousel would work. Defining three 
 carousel classes resolved this issue, however there is most likely a better fix.
